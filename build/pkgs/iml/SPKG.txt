== Description ==

IML is a free library of C source code which implements algorithms for
computing exact solutions to dense systems of linear equations over the
integers. IML is designed to be used with the ATLAS/BLAS library and
GMP bignum library.

Written in portable C, IML can be used on both 32-bit and 64-bit
machines. It can be called from C++.

 * GMP/MPIR

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Sage's current version is fairly out of date. As of June 2013, the
   latest upstream release is 1.0.3 (dated July 28th 2008).
 * Various files should be made executable. Run spkg-src after
   extracting the sources to src/ to fix this.

=== Patches ===

 * rename_lift.patch: Change lift to iml_lift in padiclift.* and
   nonsingsolve.*, since otherwise  on OSX you'll have horrible weird
   conflict problems.
 * Modified some of the examples, and made build scripts that work.

== Changelog ==

=== iml-1.0.1.p15 (Jean-Pierre Flori, Jeroen Demeyer, 11 June 2013) ===
 * #14699: Cleanup spkg, restore upstream sources, moved patches
   into patch files in patches/
 * Do not build/install src/repl at all, since it does nothing anyway
   and creating empty archives fails on OS X.

=== iml-1.0.1.p14 (Simon King, 10th December 2011) ===
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE.

=== iml-1.0.1.p13 (David Kirkby, 22nd June, 2010) ===
