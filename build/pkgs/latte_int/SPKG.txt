== Upstream Contact ==

Matthias KÃ¶ppe, UC Davis, CA, USA

== Dependencies ==

GMP (MPIR), 4ti2, NTL, cddlib.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * the upstream tarball is extracted from the tarball of tarballs bundle latte-integrale at
   https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/
 * the name should be changed from latte-int-* to latte_int-* to reflect the Sage package
   naming; not only for the tarball itself, but also for its contents; i.e. you should
   untar latte-int-*.tar.gz somewhere, move latte-int-*/ to latte_int-*/, and make the tarball
   again.
