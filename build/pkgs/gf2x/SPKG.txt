== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * As some patches touch config/acinclude.m4, we have to touch aclocal.m4,
   configure, Makefile.in and gf2x/gf2x-config.h.in to prevent autotools
   to try to regenerate these files.

=== Patches ===
 * 0001-Trac-15014-Let-gf2x-build-a-shared-library-on-Cygwin.patch: pass
   -no-undefined flag to libtool.
 * 0002-tr-portability.patch: backport upstream fix for non-portable tr use
 * 0003-Improve-detection-of-sse2-support.patch: backport upstream improved
   check for sse2
 * 0004-Add-disable-hardware-specific-code.patch: add option
   --disable-hardware-specific-code to build system. This is partly
   backported from upstream.
 * 0005-Update-autotooled-files.patch: the above patches make changes to
   code used by autotools for generation of the build system. This patches
   those files, so that autotools need not be installed.
