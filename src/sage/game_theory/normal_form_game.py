2 Player normal form games

This module implements characteristic function cooperative games.
The main contribution is a class for a characteristic function game.
Methods to calculate the Shapley value (a fair way of sharing common
resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThG4YAFErw) as well as
test properties of the game (monotonicity, super additivity) are also included.
This module implements 2 by 2 normal form (bi-matrix) games. A variety of operations on these games can be carried out:

- Identification of (weakly) dominated strategies;
- Identification of Best responses to a given strategy;
- Identification of Nash Equilibrium (this is done by interfacing with Gambit);

class NormalFormGame(SageObject):
    r"""
    An object representing a normal form game.

    INPUT:

    - Bi matrix: can be input as two matrices, an array of two dimensional lists OR a single matrix in which case it will be assumed that the game is zero sum.
    - Strategy names - default = ``False``, if a list of names is passed then all strategy vectors will be returned as dictionaries...

    EXAMPLES::
    Basic example of how to initiate a normal form game using two matrices. ::

        sage: A = matrix([[2,0],
        ....:             [5,1]])
        sage: B = matrix([[2,5],
        ....:             [0,1]])
        sage: game = NormalFormGame(A, B)
        sage: game.show()

        sage: D = matrix([[2, 5],
        ....:             [1, 0]])
        sage: game = NormalFormGame(D)
        sage: game.show()
