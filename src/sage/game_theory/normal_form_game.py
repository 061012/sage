2 Player normal form games

This module implements 2 by 2 normal form (bi-matrix) games. A variety of
operations on these games can be carried out:

- Identification of (weakly) dominated strategies;
- Identification of Best responses to a given strategy;
- Identification of Nash Equilibrium (this is done by interfacing with Gambit);

class NormalFormGame(Game):
    r"""
    An object representing a Normal Form Game. Primarily used to compute the
    Nash Equilibrium.

    INPUT:

    If 2 matrices are passed in the list then the corresponding Normal
    Form Game is produced.
    If a single matrix is passed in the list then the corresponding zero
    sum game is produced.
    If a gambit game object is passed then the corresponding game is created.

    - ``payoff_matrices`` - a list of payoff matrices defining a
                            Normal Form game.
    - ``game`` - an instance of gambit.Game().

    EXAMPLES:

    A basic 2-player game constructed from matrices. ::

        sage: A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        sage: B = matrix([[3, 3], [1, 4]])
        sage: C = NormalFormGame([A, B])

    This can be given a title and the players can be named. ::

        sage: C.title = "Simple Game"
        sage: C.players[int(0)].label = "James"
        sage: C.players[int(1)].label = "Vince"

    We can also pass a Gambit game and create it manually.

    This can be solved using ``obtain_Nash``. ::

        sage: g.obtain_Nash()
        [[[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]]]

    Here is an example of a 3 by 2 game ::

        sage: A = matrix([[3,3],
        ....:             [2,5],
        ....:             [0,6]])
        sage: B = matrix([[3,2],
        ....:             [2,6],
        ....:             [3,1]])
        sage: g = NormalFormGame(A,B)

    This particular game has 3 Nash equilibrium ::

        sage: g.obtain_Nash()
        [[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]],
         [[0.8, 0.2, 0.0], [0.6666666667, 0.3333333333]],
         [[0.0, 0.3333333333, 0.6666666667], [0.3333333333, 0.6666666667]]]

    Here is a slightly larger game ::

        sage: A = matrix([[160, 205, 44],
        ....:       [175, 180, 45],
        ....:       [201, 204, 50],
        ....:       [120, 207, 49]])
        sage: B = matrix([[2, 2, 2],
        ....:             [1, 0, 0],
        ....:             [3, 4, 1],
        ....:             [4, 1, 2]])
        sage: g=NormalFormGame(A,B)
        sage: g.obtain_Nash()
        [[[0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], [0.0357142857, 0.9642857143, 0.0]]]

    One can also input a single matrix and then a zero sum game is constructed.
    Here is an instance of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock ::

        sage: A = matrix([[0, -1, 1, 1, -1],
        ....:             [1, 0, -1, -1, 1],
        ....:             [-1, 1, 0, 1 , -1],
        ....:             [-1, 1, -1, 0, 1],
        ....:             [1, -1, 1, -1, 0]])
        sage: g = NormalFormGame(A)
        sage: g.obtain_Nash()
        [[[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]]]

    Here is a slightly longer game.
    Consider the following:

    An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers.
    Both suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques.
    An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains
    that the airline is liable for a maximum of 10 per suitcase, and in
    order to determine an honest appraised value of the antiques the manager
    separates both travelers so they canâ€™t confer, and asks them to write
    down the amount of their value at no less than 2 and no larger than 100.
    He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will
    treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and
    reimburse both travelers that amount.
    However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other,
    this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value,
    and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus:
    2 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value
    and a 2 deduction will be taken from the person who wrote down the higher amount.
    The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide
    the value they should write down?

    In the following we create the game and solve it ::

    sage: K = 10  # Modifying this value lets us play with games of any size
    sage: A = matrix([[min(i,j) + 2 * sign(j-i)  for j in range(2, K+1)]  for i in range(2, K+1)])
    sage: B = matrix([[min(i,j) + 2 * sign(i-j)  for j in range(2, K+1)]  for i in range(2, K+1)])
    sage: g = NormalFormGame(A, B)
    sage: g.obtain_Nash()
    [[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
      [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]]

    The equilibrium strategy is thus for both players to state that the value of their suitcase is 2.
