    Return the flow polytope of `G`

    The flow polytope of a directed graph is a polytope formed by
    assigning a nonnegative flow to each of the edges of the graph such that
    the flow is conserved on internal vertices, and there is a unit of
    flow entering the sources and leaving the sinks.

    The faces and volume of these polytopes are of interest. Examples of
    these polytopes are the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope and the
    Pitman-Stanley polytope.

    EXAMPLES:

    A commutative square::

        sage: G = DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4]})
        sage: fl = G.flow_polytope(); fl
        A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull
        of 2 vertices
        sage: fl.vertices()
        (A vertex at (0, 1, 0, 1), A vertex at (1, 0, 1, 0))

    A tournament on 4 vertices::

        sage: H = digraphs.TransitiveTournament(4)
        sage: fl = H.flow_polytope(); fl
        A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^6 defined as the convex hull
        of 4 vertices
        sage: fl.vertices()
        (A vertex at (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
         A vertex at (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1),
         A vertex at (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
         A vertex at (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1))
